# ERC-8183 Compliance

> **Spec source:** [https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8183](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-8183)
> **Spec version reviewed:** 2026-02-25 Draft
> **Last reviewed:** 2026-04-22

This document tracks how the APEX v1 implementation conforms to the current
ERC-8183 draft. It is refreshed per the "ERC-8183 Spec-Update Protocol" in
`CLAUDE.md` whenever the standard publishes a new revision.

---

## Summary

APEX v1's kernel (`AgenticCommerceUpgradeable`) satisfies **every
normative `MUST` and `SHOULD` clause** in ERC-8183 (2026-02-25 Draft),
including the full 6-state machine, all eight core functions, the
`optParams`-forwarding hook data encoding, the `claimRefund` safety
carve-out, ERC-165 hook checks, and a gas-bounded hook dispatch. Three
intentional, non-blocking deltas are tracked below; none of them violate
a `MUST`. The Router / Policy layer sits on top of the kernel and is
deliberately non-normative (the ERC does not specify evaluators).

## Detail Items

Every row below links the spec clause to our implementation. Code anchors
use `file:line` against the repository as of `Last reviewed` above.

### Events

The ERC lists nine events ("implementations SHOULD emit at least"). All
nine are emitted by the kernel:

## Non-blocking Deltas

These are intentional differences from the exact spec text. None of them
violate a `MUST`; each is either a `SHOULD` addition, a reference-impl-only
feature, or an explicitly-deferred optional extension.

1. **ABI deviations that follow the ERC reference implementation rather
  than its normative text.** The spec document contradicts itself in
   three places; for each we deliberately track the reference
   implementation to stay compatible with the dominant ABI in the wild,
   except where doing so would silently drop information (`setProvider`
   and `fund`), in which case we follow the normative text:
  - `**JobCreated` adds a non-indexed `hook` field** (`:73`). Our
  topic0 is
  `keccak256("JobCreated(uint256,address,address,address,uint256,address)")`.
  Indexers wired to the normative 5-parameter signature will NOT
  receive this event; ref-impl-ABI indexers WILL. Removing the field
  on a future UUPS upgrade is an ABI-only, storage-safe change if
  strict normative compatibility is later required.
  - `**createJob` invokes `_afterHook`** (`:246`) despite the spec's
  Hookable table omitting `createJob`. Mirrors the reference
  implementation.
  - `**setProvider` / `fund` match the normative text, not the
  reference implementation.** Our selectors are
  `setProvider(uint256,address,bytes)` and
  `fund(uint256,uint256,bytes)`; the reference impl drops
  `optParams` from `setProvider` and drops `expectedBudget` from
  `fund`. SDKs generated from the normative ABI call our kernel
  successfully; SDKs generated from the reference-impl ABI will
  revert with "function selector not found" on those two functions.
  Keeping the normative form is deliberate (`expectedBudget`
  provides front-running protection that the ref impl omits).
2. **Optional reference-impl features not adopted.** The 2026-02-25
  reference implementation adds `evaluatorFeeBP` and `whitelistedHooks`
   (with `HookNotWhitelisted`). These are not in normative spec text; we
   intentionally skip them:
  - `evaluatorFeeBP`: our evaluator is the Router, which has no economic
  incentive to collect a cut in v1. If this changes, add as a new
  storage slot on a UUPS upgrade.
  - `whitelistedHooks`: ERC-165 verification at creation time + the fact
  that the Router is our canonical hook are sufficient in v1. Client-
  supplied custom hooks are disabled de-facto (every routed job uses
  the Router; bespoke hooks would require a parallel code path).
3. **Optional extensions not adopted.** ERC-8183 §Extensions introduces
  two non-normative interop patterns:
  - **ERC-8004 Reputation interop.** Not implemented. Future work: emit
  reputation signals from a dedicated hook or policy, keeping the
  kernel unchanged. Tracked in `docs/design.md` §7.
  - **ERC-2771 meta-transactions / x402.** Not implemented. The kernel's
  authorisation checks use `msg.sender` rather than `_msgSender()`.
  If introduced, it requires a v2 kernel with `ERC2771Context` and a
  storage-layout audit.

### Router-layer deviation (disclosed separately)

The **Router** layer deviates from one spec `SHOULD`: "Hooks SHOULD NOT be
upgradeable after a job is created." The Router is UUPS and serves as the
hook for every routed job. This is disclosed in the Router NatSpec
header, in `README.md`, and in `docs/design.md` §6 R1, and mitigated by
multisig + Timelock governance and an operational default of "never
upgrade". The kernel itself still satisfies all `MUST` clauses.

## Change Log

- **2026-04-22** — `JobFunded` event aligned to normative spec
signature `JobFunded(jobId, client, amount)` (the extra `provider`
field is dropped; `provider` is still resolvable via `getJob` or the
indexed `JobCreated`). Deltas renumbered from four to three; explicit
indexer / SDK impact notes added for the remaining `JobCreated` hook
field and the `setProvider` / `fund` selector divergence. Re-reviewed
against ERC-8183 2026-02-25 Draft (same spec version).
- **2026-04-22** — Initial review against ERC-8183 2026-02-25 Draft. Full
normative compliance confirmed; four non-blocking deltas recorded. No
code changes required.
